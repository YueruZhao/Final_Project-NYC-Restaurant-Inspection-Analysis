# Introduction
Since July 2010, the New York Health Department has required restaurants to post letter grades showing sanitary inspection. results. An A grade proves that the restaurant has top marks for health and safety, so customers can feel secure about eating there. But customers don't know how the inspectors grade for these restaurants and if the chain restaurants has same performance in different locations. In addition to the internal reason of the restaurant, are there other external reasons affecting the score? For this project, we did data analysis and visualization of NYC restaurants inspection scores based on boros, cuisines, violation codes, chain and non-chain restaurants. We also connected the New York Housing Units by Building dataset to find out if there is any correlation between score and income units in different boros.
