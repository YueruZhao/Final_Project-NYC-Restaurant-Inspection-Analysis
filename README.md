# Introduction
Since July 2010, the New York Health Department has required restaurants to post letter grades showing sanitary inspection. results. An A grade proves that the restaurant has top marks for health and safety, so customers can feel secure about eating there. But customers don't know how the inspectors grade for these restaurants and if the chain restaurants has same performance in different locations. In addition to the internal reason of the restaurant, are there other external reasons affecting the score? For this project, we did data analysis and visualization of NYC restaurants inspection scores based on boros, cuisines, violation codes, chain and non-chain restaurants. We also connected the New York Housing Units by Building dataset to find out if there is any correlation between score and income units in different boros.
# Hypotheses
1. Non-chain restaurants have worse performance compare to chain restaurants.
2. Restaurant inspections improve the safety of restaurants(Reduce restaurant-attributable food-borne illness).
3. The more Moderate/Middle income units in that erea, the higher percentage of A in that borough.
# Results and Analysis
1. Based on the grades, the Chain restaurants have higher A percentage than Non-chain restaurant. Because A represents top marks than other grades, so we can prove that Chain restaurant has better performance than non-chain restaurant.
2. We use critical flag factor to decide the safety of the restarant. Critical violations are those most likely to contribute to food-borne illness. From the results we can see that only in Bronx, the not critical flag of re-inspection is lower than the initial inspection rate. We can say that with the inspection, restaurants have higher rate on not critical flag when doing re-inspection compare to initial inspection. So restaurant inspections improve the safey of restaurants.
3. The result does not support that the richer area it is, the higher grade will be for. So it can not prove our hypothese.
